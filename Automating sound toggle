User Story: Night Sound Toggle
Leader: Ayushpreet Singh
Description:
Night sound will adjust the audio volume in Room-settings to set the equalizer and volume settings for a better late-night experience and peace at home.

Acceptance Crieria:
Night sound toggle should be Automatic by default with an ease access to switch it in settings.
Equalizer should be changed accurately so that neither it disturbs any one else in the house nor it kills the music experience for the person listening. 
If someone tries to change the settings a pop-up should be displayed.

So i was assigned to automate the settings option to change to a particular setting at night if the speaker is on room settings and it worked pretty well.
I worte the code in pyhton and it worked as expected and hope to work witout any problems
