User Story: Alarm/Sleep timerd
Leader: Ayushpreet Singh
Description:
Inconsistent activation due to synchronization issue with the speaker or a software bug leading to missed wake up calls or interrupted sleep routines. 

Acceptance Crieria:
Checking for the bug before and after the repair
Improving synchronization with all kinds of devices
Preferring Alarm/Sleep timers over anything else playing.

So i was assigned to improve synchronization with Android and Windows of the speaker. I got the results from the tester.
I improved it by reducing the delay time and setting up a condition to give more importance to alarm/sleep timers
