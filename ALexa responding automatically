Description:
We can change the language of Alexa Wake word (IOS) by going to the sites and going through the options until finding the language options, 
which will give you the ability to change the language of Alexa Wake word (IOS)

Acceptance Crieria:
The word Alexa should be changed when Alexa speaks.
the user should find it easy to do it every time.
the user should see the current language that is being used.

Work done:
So i was responsible for automating a process where alexa will respond to the user in the language it is changed and it will be done
the same time the settings are changed and saved. I used python for this automation.
