User Story: Music Library Issues
Leader: Ayushpreet Singh
Description:
Speakers may not support all audio file formats available in a music library, leading to playback issues or complete incompatibility with certain tracks.

Acceptance Crieria:
File Formats : MP3, AAC, FLAC, WAV and ALAC should be supported
If a user plays unsupported audio file the speaker must notify the user
The speaker must successfully play all supported audio file formats without playback issues or audio quality degradation.

So i was assigned to do error handling for the playback support i.e i had to make sure that the audio doesn't degrade while being played.
This especially included alarm/sleep timers.
I also had to make sure a pop up appears when the user wants to play an unsupported file
